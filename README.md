# Assembly
Practice with Win32 Assembly. 99% of this code is coming from Iczelion's classic Win32 assembly tutorials which are as old as the internet itself. Some stuff will be slightly modified by me, others will be totally original.

make.bat is a small batch script I wrote up so I wouldn't have to keep typing the assemble and link commads.

Excuse the use of batch. Since I was learning assembly already, I was in a sadistic mood with my scripting language choice.
